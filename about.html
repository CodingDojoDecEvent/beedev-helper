            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>As with every programmer there comes a day that they have an issue learning something new.  For some visual guides explain the material better than written explanations</p>
            <p>This site started as a way to prove that I knew what I was doing as well as noticing that as I taught Web Development I seemed to explain things the same way over and over and with horrible self drawn images. I found that some of the images actually helped my students and began to think they could help others as well - even those I didn't teach</p>

            <h2>Have images or ideas?</h2>
            <p>Would you like to add some images you have created or have ideas for images to be created?  I would love to hear from you. Below is the link to the main source code and also a link to where you can push images or ideas to just simply add the ideas to the possibleIdea.txt or  the images to the linked folder.</p>
