        <h1>Object Oriented Programming</h1>
        
        <p>Welcome to the world of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). OOP is a programming paradigm that uses objects to organize code. Let's explore some basic concepts:</p>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Class:</strong> A blueprint for creating objects. It is a blueprint of an object. You need to have a class before you can create an object. </li>
            <li><strong>Object:</strong> An instance of a class, encapsulating data and behavior. Objects have properties and methods. </li>
            <li><strong>Method:</strong>  A method is a procedure associated with a class and defines the behavior of the objects that are created from the class. It is an action performed on objects: walking, driving
                properties: attributes of method: color, size, etc </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Explain to me what OOP is:<i> essentially it takes real world objects and represent them in code</i></h3>
        
        <!-- ABSTRACTION -->
        <h2>Abstraction in Programming</h2>

        <h4>Meaning/Benefit:</h4>
        <p>Only show the necessary details to the user of the object. Only exposing the necessary details needed by whomever is using the object.</p>
            <ul>
            <li>Increases Security: Only important details are provided to the user.</li>
            <li>Reduces Code Size: Not showing unnecessary code, you can just call on the function.</li>
            <li>Makes Code Readable: Makes code simpler to understand.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <p>When the user is turning on/off the monitor, they donâ€™t care much about the inner mechanisms that occur, they just want to push a button and see the computer turn on/off.</p>
        
        <h4>Coding Example:</h4>

        <a href="../images/python/abstraction-example.png" download><button>Download Image</button></a>

        <!-- INHERITANCE -->
        <h2>Inheritance in Programming</h2>

        <h4>Meaning/Benefit:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Allows code reusability.</li>
            <li>Useful when you have an existing class and want to build a new class that uses functionalities from the previous class and adds additional features.</li>
            <li>Classes derived from an existing class are called subclass, extended class, or child class.</li>
            <li>The subclass is derived from either the superclass, parent class, or the base class.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <p>So right now, we just have an enemy class. Now, say we want to make a new class called Vampire.</p>
    
        <h4>Coding Example:</h4>
        <img src="../images/python/inheritance-example.png" alt="Inheritance" class="img">
        <a href="../images/python/inheritance-example.png" download><button>Download Image</button></a>

        <!-- POLYMORPHISM -->
        <h2>Polymorphism in Programming</h2>

        <h4>Meaning/Benefits:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Allows you to determine what kind of function to run while the program is running.</li>
            <li>Allows you to define methods in the child class that have the same name as the methods in the parent class.</li>
            <li>Code reusability: once written, classes can be reused.</li>
        </ul>
    
        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <p>Create a new class called WereWolf.</p>

        <h4>Coding Example:</h4>
        <img src="../images/python/polymorphism-example.png" alt="Polymorphism" class="img">
        <a href="../images/python/polymorphism-example.png" download><button>Download Image</button></a>

        <!-- ENCAPSULATION -->
        <h2>Encapsulation in Programming</h2>

        <h4>Meaning:</h4>
        <p>Built on the idea of data hiding. Encapsulation restricts access to certain properties or methods of our object to whatever is calling that object.</p>
    
        <h4>Example:</h4>
        <p>We can do this by setting the properties to private.</p>
    
        <h4>Coding Example:</h4>
        <img src="../images/python/encapsulation-example.png" alt="Encapsulation" class="img">
        <a href="../images/python/encapsulation-example.png" download><button>Download Image</button></a>

        <h2>Importance</h2>
        <p>These are the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). By understanding and applying concepts like abstraction, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation, developers can create well-structured and reusable code that models real-world entities effectively.</p>
